
2012/12/08 -- 3.1 (r86)

enhancements:
- Update to JOGL-2.0-RC11. Should help with errors on Mac, freezes on Linux.
- Added option to show a splashscreen during startup.
- Added a script tab to the debug window. It includes a script info button to
  display the line/word count for each of the scripts.
- Added Game.addLuaInitializer() which makes it easier to make an interface in
  Lua for complex Java code. Use registerJavaClass() for simple Java objects.
- Added pushStyle/popStyle to make it easier to temporarily change the style
  within a line of text, then later change it back to the earlier style.
- Support for using soft-hyphens in words to indicate potential intra-word
  hyphenation points.
- Support for setting the default text direction to right-to-left (vn.rtl)
- Basic support for bidirectional text in TextDrawable/Button.
- TextDrawable.setAnchor()/ButtonDrawable.setTextAnchor() have been replaced
  by setVerticalAlign(). Set the horizontal align with the default text style.
- Using more aggressive coordinate rounding in text display code to make the
  text appear sharper.
- Added an optional volatile parameter to screenshot/screen2image functions
  which, when true, creates a screenshot which stores its pixels only on the
  GPU. This improves performance, but the pixels may be lost at any time.
- View CG menu option now prints a warning when it does nothing and uses a
  fade-in/fade-out effect.
- Changed behavior of 'stretch' for GridLayout, will now only increase sizes.
  Added a 'shrink' property to allow shrinking of components.
- Setting the text anchor to 0 lets the text alignment depend on the default
  directionality of the containing line of text.
- Various small improvements to the manual.
    
bugfixes:
- Choice buttons accidentally had their Z changed from -2000 to 0.
- Screenshots were taken in the wrong layer for layers containing sublayers.
- Buttons still appeared clickable in view CG mode.
- Notifications alignment was accidentally changed in v3.0
- Right-aligned text now behaves the same on the Android port.
- Incorrect decoding of Unicode code points outside the BMP in Lua.
- Lua functions didn't show up in stack traces for Java exceptions for certain
  types of errors.
- colorTex() didn't properly convert the given ARGB color to premultiplied form
- Clip rect calculation in BaseRenderer uses the rounded-to-int version.
  of the parent's clip rect as base. Repeated rounding errors could stack up.
- Errorneously included some unarchived .java files in the engine distribution.
- Removed trailing '&' in Linux launcher script, it causes the program not to
  run properly when using double-click -> run in terminal in some cases.
- Engine/project fields in Build.jar where clipped on Mac OS X.
- On some platforms, default textfield foreground is white, making the
  project/engine browse fields in Build.jar very hard to read.



2012/11/13 -- 3.0 (r69)

enhancements:
- Added better support for adding an embedded Java runtime (JRE). A 32-bit
  Windows JRE is included with NVList, enable the include-embedded-jre
  preference to add it to distributions.
- Rewrote how layers function. Layers now implement IDrawable and can be
  nested. All default layers are now created within a single root layer and
  Image.getLayers() was removed.
- Drawables can now be moved to another Layer than the one they're created in.
- Added a default 'overlay' layer which displays above any other default layer.
- Added setGlobal/getGlobal/incrGlobal/clearGlobals functions to ease working
  with the globals Java object from Lua.
- Implemented early culling in the rendering code using bounding box
  approximations for drawables (improves performance when there are many
  off-screen drawables).
- CD distributions now also include a .exe version of the installer.
- Installers included with CD distributions now extract directly from the
  no-installer .zip instead of requiring data be duplicated inside the installer
- Moved a number of layout/GUI related code from Lua to Java for increased
  performance. Moved System.(createSaveScreen/createLoadScreen/createChoice)
  to GUI.XXX  
- Removed TextButton Lua implementation, integrated functionality into IButton.
- Default choice screen now creates scroll bars when there are too many options
- Implemented a panel component for grouping and positioning images with a
  layout. The panel can also be given images to use for its background and
  edges/borders.
- Added a scrollable viewport component.
- Added a FlowLayout which positions items in rows aligned to a particular
  direction.
- Android version now uses an optional splash screen image during startup.
- Added Anim.fromFunction() which turns a Lua function into an Animator.
- Added getNextFreeSaveSlot() function which returns the index of an unused
  save slot.

bugfixes:
- Button rollover is now limited to their parent layer's clipping rect unless
  clipEnabled is false.
- ParallelAnimator looping now waits for each sub-animation to finish instead
  of looping each sub-animation separately and as fast as possible.
- NVL mode on Android now tries to fill at least half the screen before auto
  clearing the screen instead of always after each paragraph.
- Fixed a bug in blend quad rendering for the desktop version of NVList, didn't
  properly restore the previously active texture.
- Fixed a rare array bounds exception in LuaThreadGroup.
- Lua stacktraces got destroyed when tail-calling a Java function which calls
  a yielding Lua function.
- Lua evaluator in the debug tab now also accepts non-expression statements.
- CodeMirror syntax highlighter exited 'code' mode when encountering a ']'
- Lua tailcall optimization was broken for java functions resulting in a yield
  ('dofile' being the obvious one fitting that description).



2012/10/19 -- 2.9 (r35)

enhancements:
- Added screens.lua to default res folder in order to make it more
  straightforward to edit the save/load/choice/textlog screens. See also the
  custom special screens demo.

- Resource optimizer now defaults to the "size" preset and adds 1280x720,
  1024x576 target resolutions.
- Added a utility function for creating filmstrip animations
  (Anim.createFilmstrip). See image/animation tutorial for example code.

  image gallery, see script/gui/gallery.lua for more information.
    
bugfixes:
- Name tags in NVL mode were accidentally being styled with the current
  speaker's text style as well. Fixed to only use the name style.
- Fixed unintended brightness decrease when using BlendGS in combination with
  drawables with alpha less than one.
- Build.jar was supposed to update prefs.ini, but instead wrote prefs.ini.txt
- Fixed an off-by-one error for the cropping in the blur function.    
- Auto read mode broke when a line doesn't fit on the screen and a panic line
  wrap is necessary.
- Image optimizer now pads resized subimages with a scaled version of its
  former neighbor pixels instead of always with transparent pixels, thereby
  maintaining the same edge behavior when rendered with linear interpolation.
- Create project button (and some others) in Build.jar are now disabled at
  times when using them could potentially cause problems.
- Spurious error in build-game.xml:301 when no default video folder exists.
- Under rare circumstances, a repaint would not be issued after resizing,
  leading to image corruption.
- Fixed a bug in BaseImageTween that would replace the imageAlignY with
  imageAlignX if no specific anchor/imageAlignXY set.



2012/07/06 -- 2.6 (r27)

enhancements:
- Added a matrix color tint function to ImageFX. Can be used for grayscale
  effects, changing saturation, etc.
- Added an Image FX tutorial demonstrating blur, brighten, color matrix.
- Improved runtime performance of the debug window's image tab. It would cause
  lag when viewed during heavy particle effects.
- Changed some code related to tweens, removing anything that changed the
  texture anchor (image alignment) without explicit action from the user.
    
bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug in customTextBox that could cause a crash when not passing
  explicit bounds

  number of times (or infinitely by using -1).
- Added example usage for Anim.* functions to the image/animations tutorial.
- Added vn.enableProofreaderTools preference that, when enabled, adds a report
  bug/typo button to the menu bar. This button automatically adds info about the
  current script location and merges bug reports into a single file.
- Changed the interfaces of the Camera object to be compatible with the new
  Anim.* functions. See camera tutorial for details.
- Added the ability to customize the text continue cursor image using the
  customTextBox function.
- Added a second parameter to TextDrawable.setCursor() to be able to turn off
  the automatic positioning. This makes a fixed position cursor possible.
- Added a textbox customization tutorial demonstrating setCustomTextBox
- Added vn.engineTargetVersion preference to allow you to specify which NVList
  version your VN was created for. This allows built-in functions to change
  their implementation but continue to function the same way for VNs targeting
  the old NVList version.
- Added an example image gallery script as a GUI tutorial.
    
bugfixes:
- JNG images were erroneously saved with premultiplied alpha by the optimizer.

- Screenshot menu item now has the ability to save screenshots as JPEG
- Create new project button added to Build.jar, creating a new project now
  triggers an automatic rebuild. 
- Added Anim.* function for easily interpolating (animating) between two
  property values (for example color, or scale). Background animations also
  benefit; the new system saves a bit of typing.
    
bugfixes:
- Wipe tween ignored sprite transform (position, scale and rotation).
- Changes to the color or alpha of a name box would disappear after switching
  back and forth between ADV and NVL text modes
- Fixed a runtime exception when loading a 16-bit RGB image without alpha.
- Paragraphs longer than a few hundred characters could, under specific
  conditions, trigger a program crash on ATI graphics cards.
- Setting texture parameters on a GLSL object didn't force their
  initialization, making the textures appear transparent.
- Resource optimizer was broken, gave an error message when attempting to use.
- The return to title menu item accidentally reset the window size/position.
- Text (sub)lines consisting of only whitespace were eaten by the parser.



2012/05/01 -- 2.3 (r23)

enhancements:
